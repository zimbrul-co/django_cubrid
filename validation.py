"""
This module extends Django's database validation for a specific database backend. It provides
a `DatabaseValidation` class, a subclass of `BaseDatabaseValidation`, currently without
custom implementations. It's designed for Django database backend customizations, where
database-specific validation logic can be added to ensure data and schema integrity with
the underlying database system.

    """
    A subclass of Django's `BaseDatabaseValidation`, `DatabaseValidation` currently acts as
    a pass-through. It's intended for future extensions with database-specific validations.
    These would include checks and rules tailored to the specific database backend, enhancing
    data integrity within Django's ORM. Currently, it inherits all behavior from the base
    class without modifications.
